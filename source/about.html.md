# ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sebastian. I program machines for fun and profit.

It almost certian that you will disagree with things I write from time to time. As much as I like a good discussion, I do not want to discus topics with people on my page. 
This is why you will _not_ find any feedback forms or other commenting functionality on this page. 

If you disagree, I urge you to write about how and why, and link to this page. If this forces you to set up your own place for writing: great!

I hope that, altough this is not my primary goal with this blog, that some things I write can be useful for others. If so, please make sure to give me due credit, and link to this page: If you happen to cite me, add a link to the content on this page, mentioning my copyright. Thanks!

# Software and assets used

The blog and all pages are compiled into plain html by [middleman][7].

For CSS, I use [Bulma][8] as basis, customized by using [SASS][9] to compile custom CSS as well as to bend Bulma to my taste.

This blog uses fonts created and shared by by [Information Architects][6]. Thanks for making them accessible. 

Their iA Writer is a great tool - [check it out here][5].

Font licenses:

* [iA Writer Mono][1]
* [iA Writer Duo][2]
* [iA Writer Duospace][3]
* [iA Writer Quattro][4]

I am deeply impressed by the tools and assets shared by Open Source contributors â€“ people like you and me! â€“ with all of us. You are the giants a complete industry is depending on, and my job would be much less fun, if it would exists, whithout your work.
