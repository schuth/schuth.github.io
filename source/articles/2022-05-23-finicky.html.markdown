title: finicky: managing multiple browsers, task by task
---

I like Safari on the Mac.

But, at the same time, I use some Google services, which feel shaky and broken on Safari, and have a reduced feature set when running on my browser of choice [^1].

So, I have to install Chrome, but want to open only very specific links on that browser. 

Enter [finicky](https://github.com/johnste/finicky), a powerful, power-user oriented way to choose the default browser based on the URL being opened.

Beyond the basics, finicky adds some nice tricks, like choosing Chrome profiles based on URL, too. Enough to play around and get down the rabbit hole, if you like.
