title: An engineering vision
---

In January 2022 I was asked to write up my "engineering vision" as part of a job interview process.

I did not get the job[^1], but I think the document (slightly edited) might be useful for me to reference it, and maybe for other people to read.

[You can find it here](/engineering-vision-2022-01.html).[^2]

[^1]: And I did not get paid for this, so the right to use the document belongs to me.
[^2]: I wrote the original document in markdown. Embedding it here messes with the header structure so much that putting it into this article directly looked and felt wrong to me, so: yes, one more click.
