title: ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Tired of Twitter[^1], and dragged down by the fact that 
even smart people seem to get converted into idiots on Twitter from time to time, I decided to degarde 
Twitter to my blog post announcement machine exclusively. 

Whoever cares about writing should make sure to own the publishing platform.

Setting up this blog was relatively easy, and compared with getting to actually write stuff, not a big accomplishment.

As everybody else starting a blog, I will try to write here regularly. Let's see.

[^1]: not tired of writing, but tired of being tempted to read there _before_ I write myself, wasting time on bullshit.
