title: ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Tired of Twitter[^1], and dragged down by the fact that 
even smart people seem to get converted into idiots on Twitter from time to time, I decided to degarde 
Twitter to my blog post announcement machine exclusively. 

As everybody else starting a blog, I will try to write here regularly. Let's see.

Whoever cares about writing should make sure to own the publishing platform.

> Schreiben vor schrauben. (K)

[^1]: not tired of writing, but tired of being tempted to read there _before_ I write myself, wasting time on bullshit.
