title: May

May 2022 changes a lot for me. I started a new job at [jobvalley](https://jobvalley.com), and I am super exited about the new job and role, getting to code more is exiting!

That being said, I will miss the people at my old employer, BetterDoc, a lot. I am very proud of what we have started, and I feel sorry for not being able to finish it up, but at the same time: you are never finished with software, right?

I will work a reduced number of weekly hours in May, allowing me a less stressful start.
